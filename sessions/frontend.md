# Frontend - Recent developments and upcoming changes in Gerrit's UI

After the successful launch of the Polygerrit rewrite in 2018, Google has moved
the frontend team from California to Munich. We would like to introduce
ourselves and talk about the work that we have done in 2019 and the roadmap for
the next two quarters.

The talk will give an overview of infratstructure changes (e.g. Polymer 2
migration) and provide an update for all client plugin developers of what they
can expect. But most importantly we want to talk about what we have identified
as the main points in the Gerrit user experience and how we are planning to
address them.

We will go into more detail about a feature that is planned for the 3.2 release:
The Attention Set. It is designed to replace the current "assignee" feature and
ensure that during review, it is always clear whose turn it is. So users will
have a much easier time to find out which changes need their attention and which
ones they can currently ignore.

Also beyond the talk Delphine, Marian and Ben are very eager to listen to any
feedback you have about the Gerrit user interace and your experience with it.
