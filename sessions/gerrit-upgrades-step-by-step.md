# Gerrit upgrades, step-by-step

Upgrading is always a pain, no matter big or small.
Gerrit 3.1 is planned to be released on November 2019 and, sooner or later,
all the current older versions would need to be migrated to a modern 3.x release.

This talk is to demystify the fears of upgrading and covering step-by-step,
all the DOs and DONTs of the process, from a real-life example of upgrading
in GerritHub.io and with large Gerrit Enterprise setups.

Join me for seeing in practice how to make your upgrade path smoother and less
painful. See how the upgrade can be also achieved without having to stop the
incoming traffic to your Gerrit servers.
