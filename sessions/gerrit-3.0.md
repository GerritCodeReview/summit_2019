# Gerrit 3.0, and beyond

Gerrit 3.0 it out! If you've tried 2.16, you may have already seen the new
database backend (NoteDb) and UI (PolyGerrit). With 2.16 and 3.0, these features
are better than ever. In Gerrit 3.0, we've deleted thousands and thousands of
lines from Gerrit's codebase.

Join me for a tour of new features you can use today, and a discussion about even
more things to look forward to once we've freed ourselves from the burden of some
of our legacy code.
