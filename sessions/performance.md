# Towards a lightning-fast Gerrit

Gerrit users expect their code-review tool of choice to be fast. Rightfully so!

In this talk, I will speak about what performance improvements were made in the
last ~1.5 years and give an outlook of what is to come. We will go over the
methodology that we follow, talk about the metrics that get collected and how
impact is assessed.

We will close off with some hands-on tips on how to tune your Gerrit instance
especially with respect to an upgrade to NoteDb in Gerrit 3.0.

This talk will be given by video conference.
