# Code review: lessons from the trenches

Code review is a difficult craft to master, and contrary to what one might
think, it does not magically become easier with time. This talk is a state
of the lessons learned by practicing code reviews on the Tuleap project.

How to do it? What should be reviewed? Who reviews the code? How to make a
constructive review? are among the questions addressed in this talk.
