# Gerrit goes Multi-site, a 100% OpenSource solution

Last year we presented the vision and road-map of Gerrit multi-master
setup at GerritHub.io.
This year GerritForge and the Gerrit community have released the first
version of the multi-site plugin, based on the legacy of the successful
high-availability plugin started years ago by Ericsson.

The multi-site plugin is a 100% OpenSource solution and does not require
any proprietary software installed or hardware/software level filesystem
replication: it is fully based on the replication, healthcheck and
multi-site plugins.

Multi-site is a journey and the Community is making big steps towards it.

Let's discuss where we are in the journey to multi-site
and what are the next steps.
