# What's cooking in JGit

An overview of recent developments in JGit on the server side.

We will introduce some of the latest developments in the JGit server side. We
will talk about features implemented recently (server-side options,
sideband-all, bitmap-based reachability checks) and currently in the works
(packfile-offloading, client-side reftables). This is also a good chance to talk
about what we are looking forward in JGit in the near future.
