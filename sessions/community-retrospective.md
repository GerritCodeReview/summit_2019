# Community Retrospective

Together as a community we want to reflect on how we collaborate on the Gerrit
Code Review project. We want to understand what are pain points, what is working
well and what we want to improve. This is an interactive session that involves
everyone in the room to give feedback, share thoughts and discuss.

The format of this session roughly follows the way how Scrum retrospectives are
done. I will make an introduction and share results from the community survey
that we did in July 2019, then everyone is asked to share points via post-its on
a virtual whiteboard. We will cluster topics and discuss the ones which gain
most interest, possibly with deducing action items from them.

To take part in the brainstorming participants need a notebook with a browser
and a connection to the internet.
