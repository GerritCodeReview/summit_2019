# Gerrit load testing with Gatling

Gatling is a highly capable load testing tool. It is designed for ease of use,
maintainability and high performance.
Out of the box, Gatling comes with excellent support of the HTTP protocol, but
it doesn't have any support for Git.

In this talk I will show how to extend Gatling to use a different protocol
focusing in particular on Git.
The Git extension for Gatling is already an actively maintained
[open source library](https://github.com/GerritForge/gatling-git).
I will show different use cases and scenarios based on Gerrit installation
currently in production.
