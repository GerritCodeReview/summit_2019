# Dependency visualization for code review

Could visualizing changes improve your patchset quality and review time?

Softagram's automated Impact Report presents patchsets' new, removed, and
changed files and dependencies in an easy-to-understand graphical format,
along with insights into hidden dependencies (co-changed files based on
git history) and architectural violations.

In this short showcase, we will present our new approach, and discuss how
visuals and transparency would improve architectural quality and make code
reviewers' lives easier.
