# Gerrit User Summit USA 2019 - Schedule

## Hackathon

The Gerrit Hackathon 2019 in Sunnyvale is reserved for the people that have signed up,
requested to participate and confirmed their attendance.

> __NOTE__: The Hackathon *is not* a competition but rather cooperation between people
> who work together for a week for improving and achieving a major milestone in current
> or future versions of Gerrit. There is no prize, no payment or other subsidies provided.
> Each participant would have to manage their own transport and subsistence expenses.
