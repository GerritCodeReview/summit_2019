## How to reach GerritForge from the San Jose Airport

__By Taxi__

[Uber](http://www.uber.com) and [Lyft](http://www.lyft.com) are the most popular ways of moving
around in the Silicon Valley. Use them if you are concerned about not finding parking space in Sunnyvale.

__By Car__

The travelling time from the San Jose Airport to downtown Sunnyvale is typically around 20 mins. However,
traffic conditions change rapidily in the Silicon Valley and the best route changes consequently.

Under normal conditions (very early morning, late evening and week-ends), the best route is:
- Get on CA-87 N from Airport Blvd
- Take US-101 N to N Mathilda Ave in Sunnyvale. Take the exit for Mathilda Avenue S from US-101 N
- Continue on N Mathilda Ave. Drive to S Murphy Ave

## Parking

There are several options for parking in the area. See the map below.

Please note that on Saturday morning, a farmerâ€™s market runs in Murphy Avenue, therefore this street is closed
for cars and the area can get busy with pedestrians.

## Hotels and Places to Stay

GerritForge has agreed a discounted rate for the [**Wild Palms Hotel in Sunnyvale**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wild+Palms+Hotel/@37.3515259,-122.0158228,17z/data=!4m11!1m2!3m1!2sWild+Palms+Hotel!3m7!1s0x0:0x74dd551c58050b4a!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d37.3515217!4d-122.0136338),
910 E Fremont Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94087.

Staying in the same Hotel helps __to reduce the overall carbon footprint__ of the event by leveraging Carpooling
and saving costs on the transfer via Taxi or Shuttle.
Also, allows continuing the __networking of the event with the other participants__ to the Hackathon and Summit.
Most of the Gerrit maintainers and contributors will stay at the same Hotel, so you would have more chances
to have interesting conversations.
