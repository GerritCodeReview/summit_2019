## The Gerrit Community gets together

The Gerrit Community is happy to announce the Gerrit User Summit & Hackathon 2019,
THE event of the year for everything related to Gerrit Code Review and the
trunk-based development pipeline.

## Where

The Gerrit User Summit & Hackathon is hosted by [Volvo Cars their HQ in Gothenburg
(Sweden)](https://goo.gl/maps/rsjB5vsFXE2tQ5i6A) in cooperation with [GerritForge](http://www.gerritforge.com) and the [Gerrit Community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/repo-discuss/uVQbBOC9IeU).

## When

The event starts with a 5-days Hackathon 24-28th August reserved for the current
Gerrit contributors and maintainers plus anyone that is willing to start contributing
to the platform.

It will then follow with a 2-days summit 29-30th August opened to all the members
of the community or who is willing to learn and adopt Gerrit Code Review in their
development process.

## Why a Gerrit User Summit is back to Europe?

Starting from 2017, we promised to get in touch with a *wider and more diverse community*,
and, as promised, we are keen to listen to all Gerrit Users around the world, including
those located in Europe.
