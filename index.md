# Gerrit User Summit 2019

## The Gerrit Community gets together

The Gerrit Community is happy to announce the Gerrit User Summit & Hackathon 2019,
THE event of the year for everything related to Gerrit Code Review and the
trunk-based development pipeline.

## Where

The Gerrit User Summit & Hackathon is composed of two separate dates and locations, one in Sweden (Europe) and another in California (USA), to allow most of the community around the globe to attend and share their experience and ideas.

The first part of the event is a 5-days Hackathon reserved for the current
Gerrit contributors and maintainers plus anyone that is willing to start contributing
to the platform.

It will then follow with a 2-days Users Summit opened to all the members
of the community or who is willing to learn and adopt Gerrit Code Review in their
development process.

> Please note that the seats for the Hackathon are limited and your request could be declined by
> the organizer. We will do our best, however, to get people in and help increasing the community
> of contributors.

## Why two Gerrit User Summits, in Europe and USA?

Starting from 2017, we promised to get in touch with a *wider and more diverse community*,
and, as promised, we are keen to listen to all Gerrit Users around the world.

Historically most of the Gerrit users were located in the USA. However, recently the adoption
has extended to many other locations around the world, including India, China, Korea and most
of the central and northern European countries.

Having two events on both sides of the Atlantic would help increasing the diversity of the
people attending the event and having a more organic and complete feedback on the direction
of the Gerrit roadmap.
