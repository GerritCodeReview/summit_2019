# Ossum with Gerrit!

To address the needs of modern software development teams, CollabNet launched a new SaaS
product earlier this year: [*ossum*](https://www.ossum.cloud/).
Ossum streamlines development process from idea to release while advocating use
of best software engineering practices. What comes to its version control and
code review capabilities, ossum heavily relies on Gerrit.

Almost decade ago, CollabNet tightly integrated Gerrit with their flagship product,
TeamForge, making ossum CollabNetâ€™s second product using Gerrit as its Git backend.

In addition to a brief introduction to ossum, this lightning talk will cover why we
chose Gerrit (again!) and what are some lessons learnt from TeamForge.
